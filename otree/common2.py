    better than hardcoding '/static/', which will fail silently if the file
    doesn't exist.

    this would be useful for 2 situations:
    - live pages, where {% static %} can't be used because the template was already rendered
    - for use with js_vars (don't want {% static %} mixed in with JS code)
